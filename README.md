## Mental Health Tracking App



## Summary 



We will be creating an app that will allow for user to log in and track their mental health data. They can do this daily and see a monthly view of ones emotions and feelings over time. This app will also be able to provide information about mental health that could be helpful to the users.

For first steps go to /docs/documentation to see how to install dependencies as well as more information about the app.
