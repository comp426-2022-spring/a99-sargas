### Planning Documentation :

Throughout the process planning was done primarily through GroupMe, with very little on the github project plan. We would do in person meetings to discuss what we were going to work on until the next time we met and ask little questions within the GroupMe


## OVERALL GOAL OF THE PROJECT

For this project, we had the goal of having a homepage that would allow for a user to login and once logged in fill out a form that asked how they felt today (1-10). This form would display the data (user id feeling number and date at the time of form submission to a database). From the database we would select all the information and display a graph of the “feelings data”. This would allow people to check their mood over time and get a visualization of this. There will also be a contact page (where you could put your name and email into a database) and a More Resources page that shares different mental health resources. See images under April 12th for interface design and planning on the HTML side of things

## FINAL PROTOTYPE
Was able to create a login functionality/login database
Lacks contact us page as we didn’t create anything that would use the entries from it 
Unable to create a graph representation of the data within the developmental stage due to the amount of time it took us to make a functional login. Replacing this is a visualization via a google api which also allows access to logs on days chosen via a calendar, however!
More Resources was made and provides ample information
Can navigate through websites but not as much functionality as desired.
